    Previously, the default value was `oldest`, meaning that the recombine operator _should_ emit the
    first entry from each batch (with the recombined field). However, the actual behavior was inverted.
    This fixes the bug but also inverts the default setting so as to effectively cancel out the bug fix
    for users who were not using this setting. For users who were explicitly setting `overwrite_with`,
    this corrects the intended behavior.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
